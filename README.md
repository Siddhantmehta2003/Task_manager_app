# Task_manager_app


PLease run the app with the debbuging phase in any device like android,ios or even you can use this app as webapp by running it in google chrome, this app is a resposive app so it can run as a webapp also

I have used all the models which are described in the "Models" folder.

Please consider this as the submission to the assignment for the flutter developer post.

Thanks.
